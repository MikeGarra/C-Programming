# C++ Programming

This repository holds all the small programs that I have created over time while learning and practicing with C++ language in the Codelite IDE. Many of these programs can be found from Udemy course work. Through my course work learning from Udemy to understand C++ better I have added in the programs my own lines of code to make them more unique and more of my style of coding. If there are any updated versions of programs I have originally posted they will state so. If you have taken the time to look over my code I do truly appreciate it!
